Please send comments and feedback to users@interceptors-spec.java.net
===========================================================================

1. Editorial Changes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Editorial cleanup and conversion to the standard template.

- Assigned chapter numbers to sections and rearranged them for consistency.

- Added Chapter 1 (Overview)

- Added Chapter 3, derived from Chapter 9 of the CDI specification.
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-5)

- Rearranged various sections and examples for better flow.
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-4)

- Explained how interceptors are enabled
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-4)

- Added examples with interceptor bindings to common sections.
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-4)

- Moved description of the ejb-jar.xm deployment descriptor elements to 
  the EJB 3.2 specification.
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-7)

- Added a note on how interceptors are invoked if the same method is used 
  as a timeout method and a business method and it has both the around-
  timeout and around-invoke interceptors associated with it.
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-6)

- Explicitly noted that around-invoke and around-timeout methods may be 
  defined on superclasses of the target class or interceptor classes. However,
  only one method of each type may be defined on a given class.
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-6)

- Added a note to the around-invoke interceptor method explaining that the
  throw Exception clause in the signature may be replaced with the specific 
  checked exception declared on the method it interpose on.
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-6)
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-8)

- Added a note to the around-timeout interceptor method explaining that the
  throw Exception clause in the signature is not required.
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-6)
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-8)

- Added a note that transaction context of interceptors may be changed by 
  transactional interceptors in the invocation chain
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-9)

- Clarified statement regarding transaction context of lifecycle callback 
  methods, as it was not correct for singleton and stateful session beans. 
  Expanded footnote to clarify.
  (http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-2)

===========================================================================

2. Relaxed method signature rules for the lifecycle interceptor methods 
declared on an interceptor class:
(http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-10)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Lifecycle callback interceptor methods defined on an interceptor class must 
  have one of the following signatures:

      void <METHOD>(InvocationContext)
      Object <METHOD>(InvocationContext) throws Exception

  Note: A lifecycle callback interceptor method must not throw application 
  exceptions, but it may be declared to throw checked exceptions including the 
  java.lang.Exception if the same interceptor method interposes on business 
  or timeout methods in addition to lifecycle events. If a lifecycle callback 
  interceptor method returns a value, it is ignored by the container.

===========================================================================

3. Added standard Priority ranges as a static inner class of the 
javax.interceptor.Interceptor interface:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /**
     * <p>Priorities that define the order in which interceptors are
     * invoked.  These values should be used with the
     * {@link javax.annotations.Priority Priority} annotation.
     * <ul>
     * <li>Interceptors defined by platform specifications should have
     * priority values in the range <a href="#PLATFORM_BEFORE">PLATFORM_BEFORE</a>
     * up until <a href="#LIBRARY_BEFORE">LIBRARY_BEFORE</a>, or starting at
     * <a href="#PLATFORM_AFTER">PLATFORM_AFTER</a>.
     * <li>Interceptors defined by extension libraries
     * should have priority values in the range <a href="#LIBRARY_BEFORE">LIBRARY_BEFORE</a>
     * up until <a href="#APPLICATION">APPLICATION</a>, or
     * <a href="#LIBRARY_AFTER">LIBRARY_AFTER</a> up until
     * <a href="#PLATFORM_AFTER">PLATFORM_AFTER</a>.
     * <li>Interceptors defined by applications should have priority values in the range
     * <a href="#APPLICATION">APPLICATION</a> up until
     * <a href="#LIBRARY_AFTER">LIBRARY_AFTER</a>.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>An interceptor that must be invoked before or
     * after another defined interceptor can choose any appropriate
     * value.</p>
     *
     * <p>Interceptors with smaller priority values are called first. If more than
     * one interceptor has the same priority, the relative order of these interceptor
     * is undefined.</p>
     *
     * <p>For example, an extension library might define an interceptor
     * like this:</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * &#064;Priority(Interceptor.Priority.LIBRARY_BEFORE+10)
     * &#064;Interceptor
     * public class ValidationInterceptor { ... }
     * </pre>
     *
     *
     * @since Interceptors 1.2
     */
    public static class Priority {
        private Priority() { }  // don't allow instances

        /**
         * Start of range for early interceptors defined by
         * platform specifications.
         */
        public static final int PLATFORM_BEFORE = 0;

        /**
         * Start of range for early interceptors defined by
         * extension libraries.
         */
        public static final int LIBRARY_BEFORE = 1000;

        /**
         * Start of range for interceptors defined by
         * applications.
         */
        public static final int APPLICATION = 2000;

        /**
         * Start of range for late interceptors defined by
         * extension libraries.
         */
        public static final int LIBRARY_AFTER = 3000;

        /**
         * Start of range for late interceptors defined by
         * platform specifications.
         */
        public static final int PLATFORM_AFTER = 4000;
    }

===========================================================================

4. Added the AroundConstruct lifecycle callback interceptor:
(http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /**
     * <p>Designates an interceptor method that receives a callback when
     * the target class constructor is invoked.
     * </p>
     * <p>The method to which this annotation is applied must have one of the
     * following signatures.
     * </p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * &#064;AroundConstruct
     * public void &#060;METHOD&#062;(InvocationContext ctx) { ... }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <pre>
     * &#064;AroundConstruct
     * public Object &#060;METHOD&#062;(InvocationContext ctx) throws Exception { ... }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>An <tt>AroundConstruct</tt> interceptor method may be only declared on an interceptor class.</p>
     *
     * <p>An interceptor class must not declare more than one <tt>AroundConstruct</tt>
     * method.</p>
     *
     * <p><tt>AroundConstruct</tt> methods may throw runtime exceptions,
     * but not checked exceptions.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p> The target instance is created and its constructor injection is performed, if applicable,
     * when the last interceptor method in the <tt>AroundConstruct</tt> interceptor chain invokes
     * the {@link javax.interceptor.InvocationContext#proceed()} method.
     *
     * <p>An <tt>AroundConstruct</tt> interceptor method should exercise caution accessing the instance which
     * constructor it interposes on.</p>
     *
     * @since Interceptors 1.2
     */
    @Target({ElementType.METHOD})
    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
    public @interface AroundConstruct {
    }
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When a AroundConstruct lifecycle callback interceptor is used, the 
  following rules apply:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - The AroundConstruct lifecycle callback is invoked after the dependency 
    injection has been completed on instances of all interceptor classes 
    associated with the target class. Injection of the target component into 
    interceptor instances that are invoked during the AroundConstruct lifecycle 
    callback is not supported.
  - The target instance is created and its constructor injection is performed, 
    if applicable, when the last interceptor method in the AroundConstruct 
    interceptor chain invokes the InvocationContext.proceed method. If the 
    InvocationContext.proceed method is not invoked by an interceptor method, 
    the target instance will not be created.
  - The AroundConstruct interceptor method can access the constructed instance 
    using the InvocationContext.getTarget method after the 
    InvocationContext.proceed completes.
  - Dependency injection on the target instance is not completed until after 
    invocation of all interceptor methods in the AroundConstruct interceptor 
    chain complete successfully.
  - The PostConstruct lifecycle callback chain for the target instance, if any, 
    will be invoked after the dependency injection has been completed on the 
    target instance.
  - An AroundConstruct lifecycle callback interceptor method should exercise 
    caution when invoking methods of the target instance since its dependency 
    injection may not have been completed.
    
===========================================================================

5. Extended InvocationContext with getConstructor method:
(http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /**
     * Returns the constructor of the target class for which the interceptor
     * was invoked.  For {@link AroundConstruct} interceptor, the constructor of the
     * target class is returned. For all other interceptors,
     * a null value is returned.
     *
     * @return the constructor, or a null value
     */
    public Constructor<?> getConstructor();

===========================================================================

6. Added AroundConstruct callback to the rules for the InvocationContext.getTarget 
   return value:
(http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /**
     * Returns the target instance. For the {@link AroundConstruct} lifecycle callback
     * interceptor method, the <tt>getTarget</tt> returns <code>null</code>
     * if called before the {@link #proceed} method.
     *
     * @return the target instance
     */
    public Object getTarget();

===========================================================================

7. Added AroundConstruct callback to the rules for the InvocationContext.proceed 
   return value:
(http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     * Proceed to the next interceptor in the interceptor chain. For the
     * around-invoke or around-timeout interceptor methods, the invocation of the
     * last interceptor method in the chain causes the invocation of the target
     * class method. For {@link AroundConstruct} lifecycle callback interceptor
     * methods, the invocation of the last interceptor method in the chain causes
     * the target instance to be created. For all other lifecycle callback
     * interceptor methods, if there is no callback method defined on the target
     * class, the invocation of proceed in the last interceptor method in the chain
     * is a no-op

===========================================================================

8. Changed return value rules for InvocationContext#getMethod method:
(http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-15)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /**
     * Returns the method of the target class for which the interceptor
     * was invoked. In a lifecycle callback interceptor for which there is no
     * corresponding lifecycle callback method on the target class or in the
     * {@link AroundConstruct} lifecycle callback interceptor method,
     * <code>getMethod</code> returns null.
     *
     * @return the method, or a null value
     */
    public Method getMethod();

===========================================================================

9. Enabled constructor-level interceptor binding options for bean class 
    constructors:
(http://java.net/jira/browse/INTERCEPTORS_SPEC-12)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Renamed section 2.8 to "Constructor- and Method-level Interceptors"

    - Added the following:
      "Constructor-level interceptors are interceptor classes associated 
      with a constructor of the target class."
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface ExcludeClassInterceptors {}

@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface ExcludeDefaultInterceptors {}

@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Interceptors

===========================================================================
